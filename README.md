# Mission-to-Mars

**The Mission-to-Mars project** is a web scraping project that retrieves the latest news articles and images related to Mars exploration from various websites and displays them in a web application. The web scraping was done using Python's Beautiful Soup library and the Splinter browser automation tool.

The project includes the following files:

scrape_mars.py: This file contains the function to scrape the data from the websites and store it in a dictionary.

app.py: This file contains the Flask web application that renders an HTML page with the scraped data.

index.html: This file contains the HTML template that displays the scraped data.

style.css: This file contains the CSS code that styles the HTML template.

The web application consists of a button that triggers the scraping function and displays the latest Mars news headlines, summaries, and images on the webpage. The application also includes a "Featured Image" section that displays the most recent image taken by the Mars Rover.

The web application was built using Flask and Bootstrap, making it responsive and easy to use on any device. The project is hosted on Heroku, a cloud platform as a service that allows the application to be accessed from anywhere with an internet connection.

Overall, this project showcases the ability to use web scraping techniques to gather data from multiple sources and present it in an easy-to-read format using web development tools.
